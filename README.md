# Advanced Area Computation System - A Comprehensive Geometric and Curvilinear Area Solver

## Overview

The **Area Computation System** is an advanced C program designed to compute the area of various geometric shapes and curves with precision and ease. This project goes beyond the ordinary by not only handling standard shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles but also extending its capabilities to calculate areas under complex curves such as linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. This makes it a versatile tool for students, engineers, and professionals who require accurate area calculations for both simple and complex geometries.

## Features

### 1. **Geometric Shapes**
   - **Rectangle**: Calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and breadth.
   - **Triangle**: Compute the area of a triangle using two sides and the included angle.
   - **Ellipse**: Determine the area of an ellipse using its major and minor axes.
   - **Trapezium**: Find the area of a trapezium using the lengths of its parallel sides and the height.
   - **Circle**: Calculate the area of a circle using its radius.
   - **Regular Hexagon**: Compute the area of a regular hexagon using its side length.
   - **Rectangular Arena**: Calculate the area of a rectangular arena, which includes a rectangular area and a semicircular area at each end.

### 2. **Curvilinear Areas**
   - **Linear Curve**: Calculate the area under a linear function (y = mx + c) between two x-values.
   - **Quadratic Curve**: Compute the area under a quadratic function (ax² + bx + c) within a specified interval.
   - **Exponential Curve**: Determine the area under an exponential function (a^(bx)) between two x-values.

### 3. **Unit Conversion**
   - The program allows users to convert the calculated area from square meters (m²) to other units such as square centimeters (cm²) or square inches (in²).

### 4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - The program features a clear and intuitive menu-driven interface, making it easy for users to select the desired shape or curve and input the necessary parameters.

## How to Use It and All Its Features

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Compile the Program**: 
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC). Compile the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     gcc area_calculator.c -o area_calculator -lm
     ```

2. **Run the Program**: 
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./area_calculator
     ```

3. **Select a Shape or Curve**: 
   - The program will display a menu of options. Enter the corresponding number for the shape or curve you wish to calculate the area for.

4. **Input Parameters**: 
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required parameters (e.g., dimensions, coefficients, intervals).

5. **View the Result**: 
   - The program will compute and display the area in square meters (m²). You will then have the option to convert the area to other units if desired.

6. **Repeat or Exit**: 
   - After viewing the result, you can choose to calculate another area or exit the program.
