# Area Calculation Program

This program calculates the area of various geometric shapes and curves based on user input. The user is prompted to choose a shape or curve, input relevant parameters, and the 
program calculates and displays the corresponding area.

## Shapes and Curves Supported:

1. **Rectangle**
2. **Triangle**
3. **Ellipse**
4. **Trapezium**
5. **Circle**
6. **Regular Hexagon**
7. **Rectangular Arena**
8. **Linear Curve**
9. **Quadratic Curve**
10. **Exponential Curve**

## How to Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Choose a shape or curve by entering the corresponding number between 1 and 10.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary parameters.
4. The program will calculate and display the area.
5. Optionally, choose to convert the area to different units (cmˆ2 or inˆ2).

## Units Conversion:

If desired, the user can choose to convert the calculated area to other units. The program currently supports conversion to:

- **cmˆ2**
- **inˆ2**      

## Note:

- The area is calculated in square meters (mˆ2) by default.
- Ensure to follow the instructions for each shape or curve to input the required information correctly.
- In order to find area of another shape/curve, you may also select your desired shape by following the instructions given.
